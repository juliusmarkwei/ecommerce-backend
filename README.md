<img src="./assets/others/restframework logo.png">

## A fully functional Django Rest API project build and tested with <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">restframework</a> and deployed to <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a>

The project was inspired by a random database schema of an ecommerce website I found on <a href="https://azimutt.app/gallery/e-commerce">Azimutt gallery</a>. Every piece of this project required alot of time and research since it was one of my beginner projects build in django. The activities involved in this project are as follows:

1. Database model (table) development development and configurations
2. Writing the various API views for all the neccessary methods of each view
3. Admin panel management configurations.
4. Adding all the neccesary URL endpoints to for all the various views and thier methods. Not fogetting the admin panel too.
5. Writing tests for all the views and thier methods. I also used Postman for testing as well.
5. Including a documentation for the project through a python module called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openapi3/">drf-yash</a> by <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI Initiative</a>.
5. Dockerized the Django Rest API whci I was able to successfully run on my local machine.
6. Deploy the Django REST API to <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a>
